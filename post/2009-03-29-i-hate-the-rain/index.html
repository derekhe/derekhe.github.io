Yes, it’s true for the farmers, for the plants, for the new fresh leaves. Spring brings them new life each year.</p>
<p>I hate the rain, especially today. I started from home to Meten early in the afternoon. It started to rain when I was halfway. I knew that I had to take a bus in the rainy day, not by bike. Searched at the online map, I found out I can take No.27 bus first to Renmin Road and then take No.16 bus to the place near Meten.</p>
<p>It was fine that it took me about 40 minutes to get there, probably 2 times longer than riding a bike. The rain stopped when I got Meten. Would it start rain again? I guess so. If it was not rainy, I should ride a bike then it would be easier and faster to get back to school.</p>
<p>I reviewed and previewed my courses and had supper at about six. Meal was not very bad, but a little expensive. After I finished, I went to AV room to watch “The Assassination of the Hitler”. You might have seen that before. It is a good movie.</p>
<p>I had to go when clock was pointing to eight.</p>
<p>Bad luck, it rained again, heavier than before.</p>
<p>But the worst was, I couldn’t find the No.16 bus station on the way back. I went to the opposite of the station where I got off when I came, but to my disappointed there was no bus station near there. Where was it?</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes’ walk, I gave up. I’d better to go back to see the roadmap. It pointed out that the No.16 bus would not came back here because of the constuction of the subway. I had to get a taxi.</p>
<p>I was sure I had a bad luck this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays I missed my salon class and I also missed the girl.</p>
<p>On Thursday I was busy writting documents and got too tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday I walked a long way to get on the No.37 bus, but it’s too crowded that I was barely out of the door. I got off after 2 stations and walked again to take No.42 bus. It was unlucky that I missed the right station. I really sad at that time… It was wasting of time, I really dislike it.</p>
<p>Could god save me next week?</p>
<p>Hope things get better next week!</p>
