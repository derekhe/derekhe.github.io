On the website, you can download all of the podcasts and read the scripts online by free. There are now 670-odd podcasts on the website, so it is a huge treasure for English learners.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could create a tool and download them all at once including the audio index and the script and then convert them to a plain text form in order that I can listen to the podcast and read the script on my phone. To realize my idea, I wrote a small program by python under Linux.</p>
<p>Download it:</p>
<p>[download id=32]</p>
<p>How to steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure you are using Linux or Unix system or Cygwin system.</li>
<li>Make sure you have installed Python 2.x</li>
<li>Copy the script to any folder you like.</li>
<li>Make sure you have right to create a sub-directory under this folder. My script will create a folder called “eslpod” to store the content.</li>
<li>Run this script.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will see the script start to fetch the pages and download the podcasts. Downloaded files will store under “eslpod” folder and grouping by the tag. Under every tag, you could see the script with .html suffix and podcast with .mp3 suffix.</p>
<p>You can interrupt the downloading process by kill the process.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:* Use this script at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>This program may fail if the site was changed.</li>
<li>Respect the authors’ work and do not distribute without their permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>And at last, be happy and confidence to study English!</p>

I remembered I haven’t registered any conference yet. Is that a fake one? I searched the web just to find that there was really a conference here in Chengdu. I was confused but I guess it could be a mistake or I forget I’ve registered. Though it may be fake, it’s not bad see if it is real. By the way, that day was my birthday! If it was true, I would have meals for free. A big gift!</p>
<p>Conference was held at Shangri-La hotel, a five start hotel, by Sun and ministry of education from 23th to 24th. I got up early at 7:30AM then got to there at 8:30AM. I got my pass at the front desk and it is already true!</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0012.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0012.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Conference started at 9:00AM. Topic this year was about cloud computing for education and education applications from Russian and Indian, also some topic about CERNET. By the way, Sun’s topic always includs Open and Innovation.</p>

<p>I noticed I can easily catch up with native English speaker now. In the past, I would easily feel tired when listening and translating English in my heart. My English was improving!</p>
<p>There was a 15-minutes tea break, during which I went to see Sun’s new technology this year.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0023.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0023.JPG" alt></p>
<p>It was a surprise that ZhaigangHe was introducing Sun’s virtuallaztion technology. By talking to him, I finally know that he registered for me. He was now a spreader of Sun’s technology in UESTC.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0025.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0025.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Sun’s new server.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0026.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0026.JPG" alt></p>
<p>We had lunch at next door. I was a buffet dinner, both Chinese food and Western food.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0049.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0049.JPG" alt></p>
<p>In my opinion, the launch was just at average level. Five start hotel’s food is not much better than others.</p>
<p>At the afternoon, Indian professors talked about Sun’s technology used in India. It really hard to understand what they said. They always spoke ‘c’ like ‘g’, ‘p’ like ‘b’, so ‘computer’ changed to ‘gombuter’. That’s terrible for me, I could hardly fall asleep.</p>

<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0054.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0054.JPG" alt></p>
<p>The second day, the topic focused on cloud computer and innovation. To my big surprise, after the meeting, everyone of us was gave a very BIG gift - a suitcase!</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1774.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1774.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1775.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1775.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1776.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1776.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Though Sun is heavily hitted by ecnomic crysis and is bought by Orcale, it didn’t shrink the gift. This gives me a impression that Sun is not dead, this fresh life will come soon!</p>

I guess you probably have experienced fetching some pictures and text, or something bigger like short movies or musics.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, when I was listening to ERC conference which was held by Sun at Shangri-La in Chengdu, I felt a little boring when a professor talking about eduction in Russian because I didn’t quite catch him. Russian English and Indian English is a little hard to understand.</p>
<p>I have nothing to do, so I take out my phone to play. I searched WiFi singal and found hotspot of Shangri-La. April 23th was my birthday and also the release of Ubuntu 9.04. I found the download link and started to download using UCWEB which can do multi-threaded downloading. The download speed grew up to  and keep stable at almost 200kb/s. At this speed, one times faster than I had in my dormitory, I could get Ubuntu cdimage in only one hour.</p>
<p>How much enegery it cost? I opened the Nokia Engery Profiler and it showed me the real-time current and power consumption of the phone. In average, the phone ate up about 400mA or equally 1.3Watt. So my battery could keep up at least 3 hours downloading. That is to say, I could download 2GB of data from the air before my battery run out. But I’m a little afriad of the battery, it was getting a little warmer.</p>
<p>Downloading by a phone is quite “green”. Compare to a normal computer, it uses 0.1KWh every hour and my phone only uses 1% of the energy. So it could be the most energy-saving downloading method I ever seen. I’m wondering if there is some Bittorrent or Emule software I can use on the phone, so I could do my best to saving the earth! Besides, without a WiFi, I could do nothing.</p>

It is a good for parents to educate their children to have a warm heart although we all know most of the begs are fake.  We see these a lot.</p>
<p>If you are a driver, you proberly know some kind of people selling goods in the middle of the road, especially in some big cross with short green light time. I don’t know how large the market is, because only few people buy these goods and probably the quality is bad. This type of sell and buy is reasonable.</p>
<p>What I saw on Saturday when I was on my way to school made me laugh. Bus stopped and moved very slowly in the crowed YangXi cross. I saw an old dirty person bringing a duster and moving toward a dirty car and he started to dust the windsheild and hood. Just after he dusted a few seconds, he asked the driver for money. The driver closed the window and waved his hands asking him to go away. The dirty person found out he could not get the money and went to another car to have another try.</p>
<p>I focused on his funny begging and I laughted. Does any body give him money? I don’t. How about you?</p>
