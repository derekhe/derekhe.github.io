<p>根据长时间的观察，现在的博客已经走向了低谷了，很久没有看到有谁有个留言了。大家都在玩社交网站，交了一大堆朋友，一会儿一个留言，一会儿一个评价。QQ也学得好，整啥子抢车位、挖白菜——整个就一浪费时间。我看我博客的站点统计，流量基本上还是来自于我的hesicong.net域名的流量。大部分都是以前写的技术类文章。现在也懒了，也不想写了。最近用微软的东西越用越冒火，GDI+性能太次，串口类有一个BUG……</p>
<p>整个博客的衰落到现在的境地，让我联想起一些现象。以前QQ刚流行的时候，大家都加这个加那个，都想成为好友，见面时不时聊一聊。看看现在呢，好友上面的数量至少上百了吧，上线的寥寥无几，基本上都是隐身的。QQ除了用来追追女娃，看看照片，整个就一浪费CPU、内存的东西。好吧，你说不用吧，又总是心痒痒想打开，又总是想到可能有朋友要联系。但一上来才发现是个可有可无的东西。好吧，有时候无聊就上会儿手机QQ，一看没人聊，算了，关了，玩N-GAGE。</p>
<p>我猜想社交网站估计也差不多这样，国内学了很多，校内、开心、QQ空间、饭否，还有一些我还不甚了解。每天用着就想看看有没有朋友留言，没有留言还要制造机会叫人家留言。没事看看菜是不是被哪个偷了，车位是不是被占了。每个人其实都很闲，但一问：老大最近如何？答案多半都是：很忙。真不知道忙到哪儿去了。</p>
<p>我也一样哟。每天挂着QQ，随时看看QQ空间，再看看MAIL，再看看Wordpress。其实看看MAIL就好了，Wordpress都没有必要打开，就知道有没有留言了。</p>
<p>以前的博客，就像是私家别墅，时不时有贵宾过来看看；现在的社交网站，就像赶集买东西一样，很火。但我真不知道这东西能够火多久。</p>
<p>最后看来，我还真是落伍了，那就落伍吧……</p>

When I went to Meten by bus, I noticed a phenomenon that many people looked around to find the hummer or tried to find out where is the emergency switch of the door. And more people prefered to stand beside the door or near the  window.</p>
<p>Today, government announced the investigation of the fire that someone might bring some gaslione to the bus. According to the video of the whole burnning process, I could concluded that the bus must be fired by people because the fire started from the inner part of bus. Government also made out a plan to modify the window of the bus which has an air conditioner and would take more investment to buy new buses.</p>
<p>We must learn something from this terrible thing. First is not to take any dangerous things to the public area. Second is to be careful of people near you if he brings some suspicious things. Third is when someone is in terrible trouble, you must take your full ability to help them get out of that situation. Fourth is learn some safety knowledge in case you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>But, in the end, hope everyone is safe and happy everyday!</p>

<p>晚上坐512公交车回来，整个车就是个拖拉机一般的响声，还开着空调，听发动机声音是柴油机。还好，晚上7点过出发的车人少的可怜，找个靠窗户的位置坐下了，听着听着英语睡了一觉。</p>
<p>现在坐飞机要落到海里面，坐火车要撞散架，走路都要遭70码，在家吧，地震……</p>
<p>好吧，安安心心的，平平安安的，小心翼翼的，祝愿大家都幸福安康~</p>

I was searching my memory when I came across hi-tech things, I suddenly recalled a store happened many years ago.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, my paternal grandmother’s mother ( or my great-grandmother for short ) lived in my home for about one month. She was 80-odd years old at that time and now is a 88 old but kind mother. One day, when we all went out and came back late at night, she told me that there was a phone call in afternoon. We asked she who was that, and she just told us when the phone was ringing she told the phone directly that we were out and after a while it stopped. We knew she didn’t know how to use it. It was really not easy for an old person from country side to answer a “hi-tech” phone, so we told her that we should pick up the phone first, answer it and put it down. She knew how to do this next time.</p>
<p>Another day, she answered another phone. This time she picked up the phone and said we were not at home and then put it down. Everything was done just as we told her.</p>
<p>“Who was that?”, we asked.</p>
<p> “I don’t know. I just picked up the phone and told you were not at home and put it down”, she said.</p>
<p> “Was the person a male or female?”, we continued.</p>
<p> “Ennn, I don’t know either. I can’t tell you. I didn’t see that guy!! “, she said.</p>
<p>We really can’t help to laugh and she was embarrassed. She said she did everything we told her and in order to prove this she did a demostration to us how she answer the phone. We finally got the answer. She did all we told her - really picked up the phone and indeed said something to it and at last put it down. But the point was, she didn’t touch her ear to the headphone so she heard nothing. She laughed at last. We thought we’d better have another “Higher-tech” video phone to solve this problem.</p>

It true that rice dumpling today was very hot today and nearly sold out. TV news reported many people sold rice dumplings in the MaAnDongLu which is a road has a long history of rice dumpling making.</p>
<p>People were longing the following three days holidays. We brought many things from supermarket. Some for us and some for children. It must be the happiest month for primary students because there are nearly three holidays - International Labor Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Children’s Day. I was unlucky that my memory of the time in primary school was boring and studying forever. My parents were busy and had no time , especially no money, to enjoy the holidays. The happiest time for me was to play a computer game on Sunday and ride bike on the path of fields in the countryside.</p>
<p>Life becomes coloful when we are getting rich and have more time to travel. My friends and I are planning to hava a trip on Sunday to TianTai mountain after the offical holidays for at that time it will not be very crowded. I’m thinking about what I will do these days and perhaps I will study something. But first of all, I’ll have my hair cut. ^_^</p>
<p>At last, happy Dragon Boat Festival and enjoy your rice dumpling!</p>
