<p>Economy Hosting of Godaddy is attractive by its large disk space (150G) and nearly unlimited bandwith (1500G) . I brought Godaddy in November last year at about 250 yuan  and spent nearly 10 days to setup my space. That’s quite terrible.</p>
<p>The first is that China Telecom did something to the line, so the ping is very high and lost a lot of packages. Lots of my visitors are from China, so they may wait and wait and end up leaving my site.</p>
<p>The second is that the service at Godaddy was quite slow and you might spend a lot of time on it and have to wait for really long time.</p>
<p>The only good news for me was that Godaddy provides SSH support. With this support I wrote some programs to download something periodly. But besides this, the whole user experience was bad for any visitor from China.  I was even annoyed by the slow connection speed that I can’t post a new post sometimes.</p>
<p>Though it is not completely Godaddy’s mistake, I had to change.</p>
<p>I searched the Internet and saw the 10-Top Web Hosting provides. But when I saw the price and the comments, I lost my mind. I needed low-price but great quality hosting. After longing and comparing for couples of days, I found HawkHost(<a href="http://www.hawkhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.hawkhost.com</a>).</p>
<p>Although the space is only 3G and bandwith is only limited 30G, it is enough for my site and the price is low, at $3.29/mo (plus 45% discount when select Seattle server). The server provides many features (SVN, SSH) that others do not have. I was satisfied with its speed by by downloading the test file. Even I downloaded the file by single thread using IE, it got the maximum speed.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the best place I could put my site on and immediately I chated with the salesman online. After I was sure it was OK for me, I paied the bill. I chose Basic hosting and it costed 21$ the first year after the discount.</p>
<p>Now, my site have a new server. Enjoy the speed!</p>

In recent days, I found some English learning sites for me and I want to write a list of these site. I recommend these to you. Just look at them and  you may find it would be a huge treasure.</p>
<ul>
<li>1st: <a href="http://www.eslpod.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESL Podcast (http://www.eslpod.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You may heard about the word “Podcast”. Accoding to wikipedia, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Podcast</a>“ means:</p>
<p>A podcast is a series of digital media files, usually digital, audio, or video, that is made available for download via web syndication.</p>
<p>In Chinese, we translate it to “播客” which means a blog that has sound or video to broadcast. ESL Podcast is a site for “English as Second Language” learners. It provides podcasts and transcripts for many topics covering nearly every aspect of our daily life. You will hear a slow dialog at first, then explanation and after all comes with normal speed. Its material comes from our life, and thank Dr. Lucy Tse who writes the dialog with a lot of useful words.</p>
<p>I liked this podcast very much when I first listened to it and started to download them into my phone. I learned from this podcast by listening to it when I was on the bus or riding a bike, or sometimes did a dictation first, then compared it to the script. And with the words I learned, I tried to use them in my conversation with my English teachers and partners. By doing this persistently, I felt my English was proving magically. Hope this site help you too.</p>
<ul>
<li>2nd: <a href="http://english.cri.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRI English (http://english.cri.cn)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When I was in high school, my teacher told us to listen to BBC or VOA Special English everyday to improve our listening. But just listened to them in a short period of time, I gave up. This was not because I was lazy but the material was too far away from my life and I felt very boring. I googled and found the site – “CRI English”. “CRI” means Chinese Radio Internation, which is a official radio station reports news and life in China to the world.</p>
<p>You can listen to the boardcast “Round the clock” at <a href="mms://livexwb.cri.com.cn/clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mms://livexwb.cri.com.cn/clock</a>. And I also perfer the “<a href="http://english.cri.cn/08home/webcast.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Webcast</a>“. In this subject, we have news near us, interesting stories about people, and aha please visit and find the rest. Most of the stories have scripts, so you can listen to it and then compare. The most important thing is you will not feel boring but exciting to hear what is going on besides you, that is better than BBC or VOA in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd: <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quick and Dirty tips (http://www.quickanddirtytips.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I found this site only in a few days ago by searching “Grammar Girl”. <a href="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Grammar Girl”</a> is a podcast program on this site talking about English grammar. I subscribed mail from this site and it sends me a short mail about grammar daily. To join this, click <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/static/qd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Sign up for the grammar girl tip of the day”</a>.</p>
<p>Besides “Grammar Girl”, it is a good practice to listen to other programs on this site. Every podcast has a script but the speaker uses native speed, so if you can’t catch up with him, you can read it while listening.</p>
<p>To the last two podcast, I wrote two programs to download them. Check it out at [cref 1752] and [cref 1747]</p>
<p>So this is all my recent discovery, if any good opinions or good sites, please leave me a comment!</p>

Use at your own risk!</p>
</div></article></div><div class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/post/2009-05-10-esl-podcast-downloader/" class="post-title-link">ESL podcast downloader</a></h2><div class="post-info">May 10, 2009</div><div class="post-content"><p>When I first met ESL podcast, I found it was very useful for your listening and it expanded your vocabulary and your communicate skills. On the website, you can download all of the podcasts and read the scripts online by free. There are now 670-odd podcasts on the website, so it is a huge treasure for English learners.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I could create a tool and download them all at once including the audio index and the script and then convert them to a plain text form in order that I can listen to the podcast and read the script on my phone. To realize my idea, I wrote a small program by python under Linux.</p>
<p>Download it:</p>
<p>[download id=32]</p>
<p>How to steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be sure you are using Linux or Unix system or Cygwin system.</li>
<li>Make sure you have installed Python 2.x</li>
<li>Copy the script to any folder you like.</li>
<li>Make sure you have right to create a sub-directory under this folder. My script will create a folder called “eslpod” to store the content.</li>
<li>Run this script.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will see the script start to fetch the pages and download the podcasts. Downloaded files will store under “eslpod” folder and grouping by the tag. Under every tag, you could see the script with .html suffix and podcast with .mp3 suffix.</p>
<p>You can interrupt the downloading process by kill the process.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER:* Use this script at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>This program may fail if the site was changed.</li>
<li>Respect the authors’ work and do not distribute without their permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>And at last, be happy and confidence to study English!</p>

I remembered I haven’t registered any conference yet. Is that a fake one? I searched the web just to find that there was really a conference here in Chengdu. I was confused but I guess it could be a mistake or I forget I’ve registered. Though it may be fake, it’s not bad see if it is real. By the way, that day was my birthday! If it was true, I would have meals for free. A big gift!</p>
<p>Conference was held at Shangri-La hotel, a five start hotel, by Sun and ministry of education from 23th to 24th. I got up early at 7:30AM then got to there at 8:30AM. I got my pass at the front desk and it is already true!</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0012.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0012.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Conference started at 9:00AM. Topic this year was about cloud computing for education and education applications from Russian and Indian, also some topic about CERNET. By the way, Sun’s topic always includs Open and Innovation.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0009.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0009.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0014.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0014.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0015.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0015.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0019.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0019.JPG" alt></p>
<p>I noticed I can easily catch up with native English speaker now. In the past, I would easily feel tired when listening and translating English in my heart. My English was improving!</p>
<p>There was a 15-minutes tea break, during which I went to see Sun’s new technology this year.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0023.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0023.JPG" alt></p>
<p>It was a surprise that ZhaigangHe was introducing Sun’s virtuallaztion technology. By talking to him, I finally know that he registered for me. He was now a spreader of Sun’s technology in UESTC.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0025.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0025.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Sun’s new server.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0026.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0026.JPG" alt></p>
<p>We had lunch at next door. I was a buffet dinner, both Chinese food and Western food.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0049.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0049.JPG" alt></p>
<p>In my opinion, the launch was just at average level. Five start hotel’s food is not much better than others.</p>
<p>At the afternoon, Indian professors talked about Sun’s technology used in India. It really hard to understand what they said. They always spoke ‘c’ like ‘g’, ‘p’ like ‘b’, so ‘computer’ changed to ‘gombuter’. That’s terrible for me, I could hardly fall asleep.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0053.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0053.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_0054.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_0054.JPG" alt></p>
<p>The second day, the topic focused on cloud computer and innovation. To my big surprise, after the meeting, everyone of us was gave a very BIG gift - a suitcase!</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1774.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1774.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1775.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1775.JPG" alt></p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-4-23/IMG_1776.JPG"></a><img src="/images/2009-4-23/image/thumb/IMG_1776.JPG" alt></p>
<p>Though Sun is heavily hitted by ecnomic crysis and is bought by Orcale, it didn’t shrink the gift. This gives me a impression that Sun is not dead, this fresh life will come soon!</p>
