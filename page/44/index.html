I was searching my memory when I came across hi-tech things, I suddenly recalled a store happened many years ago.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, my paternal grandmother’s mother ( or my great-grandmother for short ) lived in my home for about one month. She was 80-odd years old at that time and now is a 88 old but kind mother. One day, when we all went out and came back late at night, she told me that there was a phone call in afternoon. We asked she who was that, and she just told us when the phone was ringing she told the phone directly that we were out and after a while it stopped. We knew she didn’t know how to use it. It was really not easy for an old person from country side to answer a “hi-tech” phone, so we told her that we should pick up the phone first, answer it and put it down. She knew how to do this next time.</p>
<p>Another day, she answered another phone. This time she picked up the phone and said we were not at home and then put it down. Everything was done just as we told her.</p>
<p>“Who was that?”, we asked.</p>
<p> “I don’t know. I just picked up the phone and told you were not at home and put it down”, she said.</p>
<p> “Was the person a male or female?”, we continued.</p>
<p> “Ennn, I don’t know either. I can’t tell you. I didn’t see that guy!! “, she said.</p>
<p>We really can’t help to laugh and she was embarrassed. She said she did everything we told her and in order to prove this she did a demostration to us how she answer the phone. We finally got the answer. She did all we told her - really picked up the phone and indeed said something to it and at last put it down. But the point was, she didn’t touch her ear to the headphone so she heard nothing. She laughed at last. We thought we’d better have another “Higher-tech” video phone to solve this problem.</p>

It true that rice dumpling today was very hot today and nearly sold out. TV news reported many people sold rice dumplings in the MaAnDongLu which is a road has a long history of rice dumpling making.</p>
<p>People were longing the following three days holidays. We brought many things from supermarket. Some for us and some for children. It must be the happiest month for primary students because there are nearly three holidays - International Labor Day, Dragon Boat Festival, and Children’s Day. I was unlucky that my memory of the time in primary school was boring and studying forever. My parents were busy and had no time , especially no money, to enjoy the holidays. The happiest time for me was to play a computer game on Sunday and ride bike on the path of fields in the countryside.</p>
<p>Life becomes coloful when we are getting rich and have more time to travel. My friends and I are planning to hava a trip on Sunday to TianTai mountain after the offical holidays for at that time it will not be very crowded. I’m thinking about what I will do these days and perhaps I will study something. But first of all, I’ll have my hair cut. ^_^</p>
<p>At last, happy Dragon Boat Festival and enjoy your rice dumpling!</p>

<p>搬东西那是一个累人。我的东西又是一大摞，之前我就搬了大半回去，搬家那天又把车开过去，装了慢慢的一备箱。离开时也没有太多的留念，也就这样吧，麻木了。</p>
<p><a href="/images/2009-5-21/20090521.jpg"></a><img src="/images/2009-5-21/image/thumb/20090521.jpg" alt></p>
<p>把东西搬到下面以后，大家都坐着聊天，等“蚂蚁搬家”过来搬。学院也是，那么多东西就派了3个车，“蚂蚁搬家”的车那简直和蚂蚁差不多大，三个车要跑两三趟才能装完，每次都是2个小时。钱没有出够就是不一样。</p>
<p>吃了中午饭，我载着寝室哥们儿一同奔向新校区。新旧校区一个多小时的车程，30多公里，经过高新西区，从成灌高速入口网上转一圈就到了。进了大门，寝室还要走很长路程才能走到，新校区确实是很大的。寝室很偏远，旁边有一条小河，我们称之为“清水河”。到寝室楼下办好了手续，就开始搬东西了。东西那是一个多啊，特别是书，最重的东西，6楼没有电梯，只要背上去。</p>
<p>寝室比较小，两人间，目前无网络无电话无热水，似乎到了农村一样。洗热水澡都是在外面的集中地方洗澡，听说只有三个喷头，看来冬天洗澡都要抢了。还好，唯一的好处就是空气质量尚可，风很大。</p>
<p>我严重质疑这里的工程问题，我们寝室的门关不了，使劲一拉，差点把拉手拉断了；其他两个哥们儿的寝室门开不开；旁边一哥们儿的寝室一关门门上的门牌掉了下来。哇，好久都没有写所谓的排比句了，竟然是写道这样的地方。不知道俺们的可爱ZSB(拼音缩写，确实是这样，还带SB两字)校长是不是想我们帮他一起搬了，这样给我们的工程！幸好地震的时候还没有房子塌下来哦。</p>
<p>在食堂办饭卡也很造孽，必须要交100块钱，更搞笑的是之前的通知上面写的“请准备零钞100”。是说准备100*1元的小抄呢还是说100元是小抄呢？搞不清楚。拿了张一卡通“临时卡”，哦，看来我们是临时的……无语中。食堂有几个笔记本电脑正在享受免费的无线网络，学校的无线网络也就这儿比较灵。永远不要听领导所谓的“笔记本校园”，“无线上网anywhere”，那就是骗小孩子的。ZSB给我们寝室安装个固话我就谢天谢地了。</p>
<p>好吧，我忍了。</p>
<p>去取钱室友买东西，停在广场上。待会儿一个保安跑过来，说“要停好久？”，我说就几分钟，他说这里不能停车的。最后雷人了一句“在这儿停车怕把地砖压坏了”。1.4吨的小轿车能把坚硬的地砖压坏了？~！看来这里的工程确实有问题，算了，以后不敢停车了，怕待会儿出来一看车陷到地里面去了我还懒得请吊车。</p>
<p>送完同学我就走了，从宿舍到主楼好远的路程啊，开车都要两三分钟，走路恐怕要半个多小时。食堂离主楼那是一个远啊，没有自行车怎么能行？我还怀疑有了自行车能不能骑上几天？算了，这些都不要想了，反正我也不在这边住。</p>
<p>从主楼正门出去，走西芯大道，IT大道，全程飚车(小声点我开得100，给警察叔叔只能说70哟~)回家，15分钟到，很快。</p>
<p>后来同学都没有上网，更搞笑的是上网回老校区实验室上网，哎，造孽。听说寝室楼的交换机都没有装，莫非真要台式机都用WiFi？！</p>

The problem was caused by Wordpress default .htaccess file which redirect 401 page to 404 page. The more detail can be found <a href="http://www.andrewrollins.com/2008/01/22/wordpress-and-htaccess-password-protected-directories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (<a href="http://www.andrewrollins.com/2008/01/22/wordpress-and-htaccess-password-protected-directories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.andrewrollins.com/2008/01/22/wordpress-and-htaccess-password-protected-directories/</a>)</p>
<p>I’ve tried three methods the article said and only found the last one is OK. I created a 401 page and put this line into .htaccess and every went well.</p>
<figure class="highlight lsl"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ErrorDocument <span class="number">401</span> /<span class="number">401.</span>shtml</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>I didn’t know the reason for the failure of another two failed because my new hosting server is LiteSpee which may not fully compatible with Apache.</p>

<p>Economy Hosting of Godaddy is attractive by its large disk space (150G) and nearly unlimited bandwith (1500G) . I brought Godaddy in November last year at about 250 yuan  and spent nearly 10 days to setup my space. That’s quite terrible.</p>
<p>The first is that China Telecom did something to the line, so the ping is very high and lost a lot of packages. Lots of my visitors are from China, so they may wait and wait and end up leaving my site.</p>
<p>The second is that the service at Godaddy was quite slow and you might spend a lot of time on it and have to wait for really long time.</p>
<p>The only good news for me was that Godaddy provides SSH support. With this support I wrote some programs to download something periodly. But besides this, the whole user experience was bad for any visitor from China.  I was even annoyed by the slow connection speed that I can’t post a new post sometimes.</p>
<p>Though it is not completely Godaddy’s mistake, I had to change.</p>
<p>I searched the Internet and saw the 10-Top Web Hosting provides. But when I saw the price and the comments, I lost my mind. I needed low-price but great quality hosting. After longing and comparing for couples of days, I found HawkHost(<a href="http://www.hawkhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.hawkhost.com</a>).</p>
<p>Although the space is only 3G and bandwith is only limited 30G, it is enough for my site and the price is low, at $3.29/mo (plus 45% discount when select Seattle server). The server provides many features (SVN, SSH) that others do not have. I was satisfied with its speed by by downloading the test file. Even I downloaded the file by single thread using IE, it got the maximum speed.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the best place I could put my site on and immediately I chated with the salesman online. After I was sure it was OK for me, I paied the bill. I chose Basic hosting and it costed 21$ the first year after the discount.</p>
<p>Now, my site have a new server. Enjoy the speed!</p>
