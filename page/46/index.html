It is a good for parents to educate their children to have a warm heart although we all know most of the begs are fake.  We see these a lot.</p>
<p>If you are a driver, you proberly know some kind of people selling goods in the middle of the road, especially in some big cross with short green light time. I don’t know how large the market is, because only few people buy these goods and probably the quality is bad. This type of sell and buy is reasonable.</p>
<p>What I saw on Saturday when I was on my way to school made me laugh. Bus stopped and moved very slowly in the crowed YangXi cross. I saw an old dirty person bringing a duster and moving toward a dirty car and he started to dust the windsheild and hood. Just after he dusted a few seconds, he asked the driver for money. The driver closed the window and waved his hands asking him to go away. The dirty person found out he could not get the money and went to another car to have another try.</p>
<p>I focused on his funny begging and I laughted. Does any body give him money? I don’t. How about you?</p>

<p>Last Saturday I went to DongXin company to debug the PCB drill machine. Things went not very smoothly as I thought because of it had too many bugs. After I finished debugging, it was late at afternoon. I went to school at about eight and had my hair cut then went home at ten.</p>
<p>Saturday I helped my father build the ceiling of our balcony. The work started at noon and finished at 5pm. If I didn’t help him, it will be a huge work to do by my father himself.</p>
<p>Because I had class at noon, I woke up early in the Sunday morning and started to go to school. I didn’t have a nice sleep that night so it was a really bad feeling when listening to someone talking and you just wanted to sleep. I couldn’t remeber what the teacher taught and I felt I would die.</p>
<p>It wasn’t getting better in Monday. I was still feeling tired. Am I lack of sleep, or am I really tired for some other reason? I don’t know. The feeling made me crazy and I could easily lost my temper. I didn’t like to talk any thing because I could hardly remeber what the word was. Even when I rode a bike back to school, I really want to had a sleep just on the road.</p>
<p>But when it was the time to sleep, I got sleepness. How bad it is!</p>
<p>Let me have a rest!</p>

If someone practices English at midnight, you may say he or she studies hard on English. But if the person played English dialog very loudly and you were having a good dream, would you accept the crazy English?</p>
<p>I just met this kind of person a few days ago. That was a little noisy before I went to sleep. Most of the time, I can’t fall asleep quickly as other roommates do. Maybe I think too much at night. I tried my best to sleep. Aha, gradually I felt my body was very relaxed and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly I woke from a very loud noisy. What was going on? Some guys were playing English dialog very loudly. I looked at my phone, it was 00:30. I got too angry and rushed out the door to see where the noise came from.</p>
<p>I found the room and shouted, “My god, why did you play that damn dialog at very night!”. I used most of my strength knocking the door again and again. To my surprise, no one answered. I got very confused, why there were no people answered the door?! How could the dialog play automatically?</p>
<p>I thought I’d better go. In addition to his funny dialog, my loud shout woke a lot of people. They were angry just as I was and wanted to see what really happened to the crazy person.</p>
<p>We knocked the door again and I even ticked the door. There still no one went out! How strange it was! My classmates told me we’d better to find out the reason, we were thinking if we had to broken the door.</p>
<p>It’s just one second before our action, the door opened. A person was very shamed and told us he was in a toilet when the computer came to be crazy. He closed his computer and said sorry to all of us. The night finally became silence. It should be an accident. People excused him and went to their room.</p>
<p>I was too excited after the funny thing happened. I had a really bad sleepless night.</p>
<p>The day came very soon and I was tired. We all didn’t know why the dialog plays automatically and at that loud. One reason I could tell was that he played the online movie but the movie was buffering and couldn’t play immediately. After a few minutes, it started to go. And at that time the person was in the toilet. How terrible the night was!</p>

Yes, it’s true for the farmers, for the plants, for the new fresh leaves. Spring brings them new life each year.</p>
<p>I hate the rain, especially today. I started from home to Meten early in the afternoon. It started to rain when I was halfway. I knew that I had to take a bus in the rainy day, not by bike. Searched at the online map, I found out I can take No.27 bus first to Renmin Road and then take No.16 bus to the place near Meten.</p>
<p>It was fine that it took me about 40 minutes to get there, probably 2 times longer than riding a bike. The rain stopped when I got Meten. Would it start rain again? I guess so. If it was not rainy, I should ride a bike then it would be easier and faster to get back to school.</p>
<p>I reviewed and previewed my courses and had supper at about six. Meal was not very bad, but a little expensive. After I finished, I went to AV room to watch “The Assassination of the Hitler”. You might have seen that before. It is a good movie.</p>
<p>I had to go when clock was pointing to eight.</p>
<p>Bad luck, it rained again, heavier than before.</p>
<p>But the worst was, I couldn’t find the No.16 bus station on the way back. I went to the opposite of the station where I got off when I came, but to my disappointed there was no bus station near there. Where was it?</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes’ walk, I gave up. I’d better to go back to see the roadmap. It pointed out that the No.16 bus would not came back here because of the constuction of the subway. I had to get a taxi.</p>
<p>I was sure I had a bad luck this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays I missed my salon class and I also missed the girl.</p>
<p>On Thursday I was busy writting documents and got too tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday I walked a long way to get on the No.37 bus, but it’s too crowded that I was barely out of the door. I got off after 2 stations and walked again to take No.42 bus. It was unlucky that I missed the right station. I really sad at that time… It was wasting of time, I really dislike it.</p>
<p>Could god save me next week?</p>
<p>Hope things get better next week!</p>
