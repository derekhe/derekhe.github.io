If someone practices English at midnight, you may say he or she studies hard on English. But if the person played English dialog very loudly and you were having a good dream, would you accept the crazy English?</p>
<p>I just met this kind of person a few days ago. That was a little noisy before I went to sleep. Most of the time, I can’t fall asleep quickly as other roommates do. Maybe I think too much at night. I tried my best to sleep. Aha, gradually I felt my body was very relaxed and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly I woke from a very loud noisy. What was going on? Some guys were playing English dialog very loudly. I looked at my phone, it was 00:30. I got too angry and rushed out the door to see where the noise came from.</p>
<p>I found the room and shouted, “My god, why did you play that damn dialog at very night!”. I used most of my strength knocking the door again and again. To my surprise, no one answered. I got very confused, why there were no people answered the door?! How could the dialog play automatically?</p>
<p>I thought I’d better go. In addition to his funny dialog, my loud shout woke a lot of people. They were angry just as I was and wanted to see what really happened to the crazy person.</p>
<p>We knocked the door again and I even ticked the door. There still no one went out! How strange it was! My classmates told me we’d better to find out the reason, we were thinking if we had to broken the door.</p>
<p>It’s just one second before our action, the door opened. A person was very shamed and told us he was in a toilet when the computer came to be crazy. He closed his computer and said sorry to all of us. The night finally became silence. It should be an accident. People excused him and went to their room.</p>
<p>I was too excited after the funny thing happened. I had a really bad sleepless night.</p>
<p>The day came very soon and I was tired. We all didn’t know why the dialog plays automatically and at that loud. One reason I could tell was that he played the online movie but the movie was buffering and couldn’t play immediately. After a few minutes, it started to go. And at that time the person was in the toilet. How terrible the night was!</p>

Yes, it’s true for the farmers, for the plants, for the new fresh leaves. Spring brings them new life each year.</p>
<p>I hate the rain, especially today. I started from home to Meten early in the afternoon. It started to rain when I was halfway. I knew that I had to take a bus in the rainy day, not by bike. Searched at the online map, I found out I can take No.27 bus first to Renmin Road and then take No.16 bus to the place near Meten.</p>
<p>It was fine that it took me about 40 minutes to get there, probably 2 times longer than riding a bike. The rain stopped when I got Meten. Would it start rain again? I guess so. If it was not rainy, I should ride a bike then it would be easier and faster to get back to school.</p>
<p>I reviewed and previewed my courses and had supper at about six. Meal was not very bad, but a little expensive. After I finished, I went to AV room to watch “The Assassination of the Hitler”. You might have seen that before. It is a good movie.</p>
<p>I had to go when clock was pointing to eight.</p>
<p>Bad luck, it rained again, heavier than before.</p>
<p>But the worst was, I couldn’t find the No.16 bus station on the way back. I went to the opposite of the station where I got off when I came, but to my disappointed there was no bus station near there. Where was it?</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes’ walk, I gave up. I’d better to go back to see the roadmap. It pointed out that the No.16 bus would not came back here because of the constuction of the subway. I had to get a taxi.</p>
<p>I was sure I had a bad luck this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesdays I missed my salon class and I also missed the girl.</p>
<p>On Thursday I was busy writting documents and got too tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday I walked a long way to get on the No.37 bus, but it’s too crowded that I was barely out of the door. I got off after 2 stations and walked again to take No.42 bus. It was unlucky that I missed the right station. I really sad at that time… It was wasting of time, I really dislike it.</p>
<p>Could god save me next week?</p>
<p>Hope things get better next week!</p>

I checked out the course but I found it was finished. I didn’t record the time course starts on my phone and I even remembered I had one class tonight.</p>
<p>Though it is not a problem, every student has one chance to book the lesson again. But I really hate missing any classes. I should be more careful in future.</p>

I worn 2 clothes at the beginning of last week but only one thin shirt at Saturday.</p>
<p>It was sunny last Sunday. After two weeks staying at home, we planned to have a trip to someplace. We’ve traveled quite a lot places last year, so it’s getting harder to choose where to go. Thanks to my clever father, he searched the web and found a place called YunDing Mountain in JinTang county, southeast of ChengDu.</p>
<p>We got up early on Sunday and started at about 9:00AM. It’s only one hour before we got to the entry of the main road of scenic spot. The road was hard to drive, and we have to go back and find another way because the road was reparing and was blocked.</p>
<p>We found another road that we did’t want. It was funny that before we left home, we said we won’t go pass cemetery for cars there would be so crowded. We had no choice.</p>

<p>Ahh, so strong the sun was, so I nearly closed my eyes!~

<p>Road was so long, narrow and wriggle. Someone put stones on the road, I didn’t know why they did that.</p>

<p>We passed by a small temple and had a short rest there. It should be a old temple here but has been destroyed during the great  proletarian cultural revolution, leaving only flowerpot from the Tang Dynasty. They said someone wanted to buy it at the cost of 100,000 but they didn’t sell it. They were the old memory or the history here.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (7).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (8).jpg)</p>
<p>We contined our rode to the top.<br>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (10).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (11).jpg)</p>
<p>There were wild yellow flowers everywhere. People picked it up and put it before the tomb in memory of their ancestors.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (12).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (13).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (14).jpg)</p>
<p>After about half an hour’s driving we arrived at the top, a temple here called YunDing Mountain which means this is the hightes temple here and colds normally flow below this temple.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (15).jpg)</p>
<p>When we were there, a lot of people were shouting and congratulating their success of conquering the hill mountain.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (16).jpg)</p>
<p>And there’s the dining hall. People here have to have dinner with others. At the first sight, everyone only pay 4 yuan to have a meal is very cheap. But when you see that 10 people only have 4 kinds of dishes, you will know that is too expensive. And having dinners with strangers was not acceptable in my mind. So we decied to eat outside.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (18).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (19).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (20).jpg)</p>
<p>At last, this is the highest hall here call TianGong Hall. It means it is a hall build above the sky. Here you can get a overview of very far away.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (21).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (22).jpg)</p>
<p>That’s all for the temple. If the main road was not under construction, we could have a better trip there. We have another chance to get there and enjoy the climbing hill.</p>
<p>We got home early afternoon. Father photoed flowers in our garden. Beautiful, aren’t they?</p>
