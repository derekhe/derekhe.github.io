I worn 2 clothes at the beginning of last week but only one thin shirt at Saturday.</p>
<p>It was sunny last Sunday. After two weeks staying at home, we planned to have a trip to someplace. We’ve traveled quite a lot places last year, so it’s getting harder to choose where to go. Thanks to my clever father, he searched the web and found a place called YunDing Mountain in JinTang county, southeast of ChengDu.</p>
<p>We got up early on Sunday and started at about 9:00AM. It’s only one hour before we got to the entry of the main road of scenic spot. The road was hard to drive, and we have to go back and find another way because the road was reparing and was blocked.</p>
<p>We found another road that we did’t want. It was funny that before we left home, we said we won’t go pass cemetery for cars there would be so crowded. We had no choice.</p>
<p>Pic: peachblossom beside the road</p>

<p>Ahh, so strong the sun was, so I nearly closed my eyes!~

<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (5).jpg)</p>
<p>Road was so long, narrow and wriggle. Someone put stones on the road, I didn’t know why they did that.</p>
<p>Pic:Stones on the center of road</p>

<p>We passed by a small temple and had a short rest there. It should be a old temple here but has been destroyed during the great  proletarian cultural revolution, leaving only flowerpot from the Tang Dynasty. They said someone wanted to buy it at the cost of 100,000 but they didn’t sell it. They were the old memory or the history here.</p>

<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (8).jpg)</p>
<p>We contined our rode to the top.<br>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (10).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (11).jpg)</p>
<p>There were wild yellow flowers everywhere. People picked it up and put it before the tomb in memory of their ancestors.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (12).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (13).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (14).jpg)</p>
<p>After about half an hour’s driving we arrived at the top, a temple here called YunDing Mountain which means this is the hightes temple here and colds normally flow below this temple.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (15).jpg)</p>
<p>When we were there, a lot of people were shouting and congratulating their success of conquering the hill mountain.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (16).jpg)</p>
<p>And there’s the dining hall. People here have to have dinner with others. At the first sight, everyone only pay 4 yuan to have a meal is very cheap. But when you see that 10 people only have 4 kinds of dishes, you will know that is too expensive. And having dinners with strangers was not acceptable in my mind. So we decied to eat outside.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (18).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (19).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (20).jpg)</p>
<p>At last, this is the highest hall here call TianGong Hall. It means it is a hall build above the sky. Here you can get a overview of very far away.</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (21).jpg)</p>
<p>[](/images/2009-3-22/image/thumb/3-22 (22).jpg)</p>
<p>That’s all for the temple. If the main road was not under construction, we could have a better trip there. We have another chance to get there and enjoy the climbing hill.</p>
<p>We got home early afternoon. Father photoed flowers in our garden. Beautiful, aren’t they?</p>

What is vampire? Do you remeber the bat flying from the hidden place and bite people’s neck in movie? That’s kind of vampire.</p>
<p>To introduce what is vampire and how to kill it, the teacher showed us a short movie called Darcula. You may hear that before. Although I doesn’t belive there is vampire, but teacher also taught us how to kill them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Burn the dead body.</li>
<li>Drive a wooden stroke through its heart.</li>
<li>(Man only) Chop off its head with a gravediggers shovel.</li>
</ol>
<p>And the end of the course, teacher played a clip of National Geographic. This clip could be found here: <a href="http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=28007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=28007</a></p>
<p>Is that real? I consider not. I don’t belive vampires and ghosts.</p>
<p>After my class I attended Joe’s study advice. I was new here. We talked about English study, he suggested us to practise at <a href="http://www.listeningexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.listeningexpress.com</a></p>
<p>At the end, write a tongue twister:</p>
<p>She sells seashells on the seashore, the shells she sells are seasheels. So if she sells shells on the seashore, I’m sure she sells seashore shells.</p>
<p>That’s all for today, have a nice sleep.</p>

<p>问题描述起来是这样的：</p>
<p>我有一个这么样一个Class：</p>
<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">BindTest</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> number = <span class="number">5</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> anotherNumber = <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> Number</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">get</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> number; &#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">set</span> &#123; number = <span class="keyword">value</span>; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> AnotherNumber</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">get</span> &#123; <span class="keyword">return</span> anotherNumber; &#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">set</span> &#123; anotherNumber = <span class="keyword">value</span>; &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>窗体上有两个控件，一个是textBox1，绑定Number属性，另一个是textBox2，绑定AnotherNumber属性。由于我需要“确认”和“取消”按钮，所以我在高级绑定里面将两个控件的绑定行为改为Never，也就是不更新它的值。</p>
<p>按照MSDN里面阐述的，使用Binding的WriteValue()方法就可以将数据更新。在我的程序里面可以这样写：textBox1.DataBinding[0].WriteValue();</p>
<p>textBox2类似的做法。</p>
<p>后来一运行，问题就出来了，仅仅能够将textBox1的值更新，而textBox2的值还原了！！！</p>
<p>一番搜索以后又回到了刚开始的那篇讨论中，有人这么说道：</p>
<p>As to the problem above this comment, it is a common malfunction of databinding. Simply, if you attempt to control the writing/reading behavior of Binding class, it will –REVERT– changes of all other non-bound fields/properties. Therefore, only first bound control gets updated due to the fact it is the only one which has access to CHANGED data, after its done with the update, it reverts the changes back thus canceling them, so other bindings are useless.</p>
<p>大意是“这是数据绑定的一个故障。简而言之，试图操作绑定类的写入和读取行为，它回将所有的未绑定的字段和属性还原。因此，仅仅只有第一个被绑定的对象能够得到修改了的数据，在它完成刷新操作之后，它将所有的修改还原因此就取消了其他控件的修改，因此绑定是无用的”</p>
<p>理解了以后，就明白了，我得重新手动写了，哎，数据绑定真是讨厌啊。</p>

His voice was fast and at the first I even could not catch what he said. I have to tell him to repeat: I’m sorry and could you please repeating that?</p>
<p>But not all students weren’t know what he said. A girl sat beside me, who brought a English novel, told me that is easy to know what he said. I did not lose my mind but listened carefully and tried to understand.</p>
<p>After a few moment, I was familar with his voice although I don’t know some words. I tried my best. Finally I almost knew every thing he said. That’s much better!</p>
<p>Complementary class was followed by private class, my teacher was an handsome American man. Todays’ topic had been English in hard times, but we enjoyed talking about other things, so finally teacher changed his mind. To me, it’s no matter what topic, I was listening and practising.</p>
<p>Here take some notes about what I learned today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, my god. Thanks heavenas.</li>
<li>handed it in</li>
<li>carry away; who’s taken it?</li>
<li>tangible, intangible</li>
<li>bolt of lightning</li>
<li>shelter – some place to hide from rain</li>
<li>soaking wet – really wet. Today is so hot that we are soaking wet.</li>
<li>witness</li>
<li>creak</li>
<li>defiance, defy</li>
<li>handout</li>
<li>spouse – wife or husband</li>
<li>accuse – eg. Maybe you have been accused of some crime?</li>
<li>paralyze – make powerless and unable to function</li>
<li>bossy</li>
<li>lousy – very bad</li>
</ul>
